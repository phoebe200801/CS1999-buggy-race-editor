            I forked the repo on GitHub and then used <code>git close</code> to make a local copy
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Once the repo was on my own machine, I was able to commit changes to version control as I went along, and I pushed back up to my GitHub repo at the end of each day. I followed GitHub's instructions and set up a SSH key so I didn't need to enter my username and password every time I pushed.
